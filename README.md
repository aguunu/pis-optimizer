# Sprint Optimizer for PIS Agile Methodology

## Overview
This project addresses a significant challenge faced in the *Projecto de Ingenieria de Software (PIS)* course at the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica. Students work in teams to develop a product using agile methodologies, specifically PisAgile. One of the main challenges is the efficient assignment and planning of tasks for each sprint. 

Currently, planning often results in an uneven distribution of workload among team members and does not always take individual preferences into account. Moreover, manual planning process consume significant time and often results in uneven distribution of hours per member and neglect of individual preferences and constraints. To address this, we propose an optimization solution using Evolutionary Algorithms to improve task assignment and planning, aiming to making planning more efficient and equitable.
